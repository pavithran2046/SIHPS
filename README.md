## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
The proposed e-waste management virtual assistant leverages the Geocoding API to locate the nearest e-waste facility based on the user's current location. It utilizes AI-powered image recognition to identify and categorize e-waste when the user takes a photo, subsequently suggesting appropriate recycling facilities. The assistant provides personalized recommendations on disposing of various e-waste types and offers guidance on securely wiping data from devices with sensitive information. To raise awareness, educational pop-ups inform users about the environmental and health hazards of improper e-waste disposal. A reward points system incentivizes users to dispose of e-waste correctly, allowing them to earn and redeem points. Additionally, a real-time analytics dashboard for e-waste facilities displays operational statistics, recycling rates, and energy savings, providing valuable insights into their performance
